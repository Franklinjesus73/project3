This project is a funcional food ordering system made in django. Beside python I did use bootstrap 4 for better control of all elements. No javascript has been used.

index.html login.html registration.html menu.html extends layout.html file user_order.html and admin_order shows list of all orders

models.py contain all data structures urls.py contain routes to functions views.py cotain main program and fuctions which renders html files

Also in static/img folder there are pictures and style.css file which contain additional styling for html

Program automatically create superuser account at first start

The personal touch its allowing site administrator to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders
